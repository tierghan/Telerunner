Gameplay plan:
An endless runner with the goal of getting the furthest you can. You cannot direcly move the player, instead the player character is teleported direcly to a crosshair whose elevation is based on the players mouse position. The player must teleport in and around obsticles to avoid death with the speed they are traveling steadily increasing.

Specifics:

Obsticles will be pre-created and spawned in an random order. For testing and such I will make at least 3 varrients. More will be added later for more gameplay, but 3 will be enough to ensure the randomization and gameplay flow is working.

The player character will either be floating (No gravity) or will have some soft gravity applied to them. I am unsure which to do as of this moment. There is potential to allow the obsticles to change the players gravity state (gravity applied/gravity no applied) but that could get annoying and hard to play around at high speeds.

Obsticle speed will be increased at a steady rate, as exponents or any other multiplicitive rate hits a wall fairly quickly. There is potential for some obsticles to increase or decrease the speed gain rate serving as rewards or traps for the player as well, though neither will outright stop the speed increase rate. A points system might also be a good idea, giving points for distance traveled combined with speed increase value or rate.

The player will only have one life, running into a wall will kill them and reset progress, though there will be some obsticles that dont outright kill the player (as mentioned above).

Obsticle patterns will start out open to allow the player to get used to the controls, then past certain distances extra "pools" of obsticle presets will be introduced to the main pool to increase technical dificulty. This will include presets that require the player to teleport through walls quickly and in sequence, or with multiple options of where to go with one path being a reward and the other a trap.
